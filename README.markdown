# GoRel

* https://github.com/jonochang/Gorel

## DESCRIPTION

GoRel is a port of [Arel](http://github.com/rails/arel), a SQL AST manager for Ruby. 

I found it quite useful, and I thought it may be useful for people working in Go.

## STATUS
I've got some good support for SELECT, and should be able to add the rest fairly soon. It also only
supports [MySQL](github.com/Philio/GoMySQL) at the moment, but adding Postgresql and others should be
fairly easy. If you'd like to use it, install gb, run the tests and have a look at them for syntax.

There's a few failing tests: I'm working on those at the momemnt.

I'd be interested to know how to do this in idiomatic Go, so feel free to leave some feedback,
or fork and I'll keep a watch on your work.
